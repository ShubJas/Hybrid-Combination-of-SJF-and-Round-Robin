# Hybrid-Combination-of-SJF-and-Round-Robin

The hybrid scheduling algorithm combines the Round Robin (RR) and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling techniques to optimize process scheduling in operating systems. This algorithm aims to strike a balance between fairness and efficiency by considering the burst time of processes.

This project gives the better accuracy for all the process comapre to other CPU scheduling algorithm.
